# Introduction

This document covers the analyses used in the paper _Tree plantations inserted in a benign environmental context can contribute to the maintenance of forest avifauna_, published in the journal **Forest Ecology and Management**.

The objectives of this study were:

(1) Investigate the effects of different forest types (Fig. 1) embedded within a benign environmental context - characterised by old stand age, the presence of understorey vegetation, and proximity to natural forest patches - on species richness, abundance and composition of understorey birds

(2) Determine potential indicator species for each forest type.
